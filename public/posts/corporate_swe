<h1>Who's a Software Engineer</h1>

<p>This question has perplexed me all through my K-12 and undergrad years, ever since I heard of the term. What will I end up doing if I go down this path? Common answers included: </p>
<ul style="float:left;width:100%;">
    <li>Software Engineers build and maintain Software</li>
    <li>Software Engineers solve algorithm problems</li>
    <li>Software Engineers make a lot of money</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are true at some level. Some of these are true at all levels. But not all of these are true at all levels.</p>
<p>It is genuinely disturbing to see how emotionally screwed up many Software Engineers are.</p>
<p>I am one of those people who took Science, Math and Computer after K-10 for the love of Mathematics. I was inspired by one of my uncle to do all the cool stuff I used to do with computers back when I was 15 or 16. That included installing the latest pirated Windows OS, trying my hands on Ubuntu and Kali linux, fixing broken stuff bought off at dirt price, trying to hack Wifi passwords using Kismet and John The Ripper among other things.
Being a hacker sounded cool to the teenager me. I tried my hands on Web Application Security, OS kernel security etc, mostly mugging up existing tutorials. I remember this website <a href="https://hackforums.net">hackforums.net</a>, that's where I went for satisfying my urge to look cool in a different way.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, and for the movie Swordfish, I took up Computer Science when the chance came. I was so longing to learn all the stuff experienced folks used to talk at <a href="https://hackforums.net">hackforums.net</a>.</p>
<p>College was a considerably different experience. To learn the subject, I am used to solving a lot of problems in an area. But in college, for every theory that is taught, I couldn't find problems at the back of textbook that can be solved using that theory. Not always. This troubled me, learning a concept and applying it for the first time in an exam is new for me.
I believe the depression(not sure if it is, but I was definitely super anxious talking to people) from missing out on my 16 and 17 gobbling up IITJEE preps.</p>
<p>After all, what'll I do after learning all these? I definitely can't be a hacker the way it's shown in Swordfish. I did not get a concrete answer from anyone. I did my first internship in final year of my college. I was in NetApp's ATG, where I worked on latest, advanced newly invented proprietary technologies. I loved it. And I was getting paid as well. Best of both worlds, I thought </p>
<p>So I started preparing for job interviews. Codechef, Hackerrank, SPOJ started filling majority of my time. And yes, I was placed, Day 0, at Intuit Inc. But I wished I had joined Zynga instead.</p>

<h3>Zynga</h3>
<p>
I joined Zynga around after 1 year 4 months working at Intuit. Zynga was fun, cool. 
Building games was challanging. I had the opportunity to work in many technology areas, from Game development to Server development to large scale data processing. 
I had those opportunities as I proved myself in the initial days of my joining. I solved an unsolved problem that has been pestering the team for a year.  
</p>

<p>But Zynga is the only place where I had that opportunity. If you're working as a Software Engineer, you're much more likely to face people problems rather than technology problems. Especially at the old and big companies. Smartness can get you past the door. After that, your political skills are as much important.</p>
<p>Each Software Engineering job is considerably different. My job at Intuit was to update a 20 year old software with the latest tax law changes in Canada. In Microsoft, however, I am working on learning a new technology every day, but only to scratch the surface. Companies expect Software Engineers to be executors, not just technically proficient. That involes talking with whoever necessary, negotiating, among other things, to get the idea implemented successfully.
Implementing the idea as fast as possible, keeping all the constraints and requirements in mind, anticipating issues early - that's the job of a Software Engineer.
</p>
<p>So who's a software engineer? Either a super hero saving the company, or middle management's scapegoats. Depends on which team you join and what your manager's values are.</p>
