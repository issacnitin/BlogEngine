<h1>Computing power is dangerous!</h1>
<p>Bitcoin was invented. Computing power became a commodity. The more computation one have, the better algorithms one can come up with, the better their chances of breaking the rules and not getting caught.</p>
<p>It was a dangerous world, but noone knew it yet. The policy makers grew up in a different generation to even fathom the danger. No, I'm not talking about AI taking over the world. I'm taking about one smart kid in a basement doing something that'll change the world for better/worse.</p>
<p>When Bill and Paul invented Windows OS, it was a market success that opened new avenues for other markets. And they had the computational power of 1/100 of the computers we have today for their business. If Bill were to be born today, and he got hold of a kick ass algorithm no-one has come up yet, that'd be the new Microsoft.</p>
<p>But is it possible, to have a drastically different algorithm that can innovate a space, and hasn't been thought of by the researchers spending their living life on it? Yes it is. You'll never know for whom the lateral thinking would kick in to see the problem in a new perspective.</p>
<p>Traditional methods of problem solving, which are reducing the problem, abstracting away the problem, solving a different problem that'll make the current problem irrelevant. These involve critical logical thinking, only smart minds can do sometimes. With experience, they might even come up with novel solutions to the problems they already solved before.</p>
<p>How about untraditional methods, such as luck, running into it, finding the perfect theorem at the right time in exact sequence it should be to solve a problem, that noone ever thought of before? Can it happen - Yes, once a million times, but there's only one Microsoft afterall.</p>
<p>That's how markets are disrupted, new markets created. 10 years of research hanging by the single factor of luck. If you have it, you have it. You don't know when you'll have it. When you have it, if you know you have it, that's when you should act on it.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, make the computing power one can have in the current free world, a threat. If used correctly, it is a much bigger threat than building a terror weapon</p>
